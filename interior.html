            Our ethos is always to deliver inspirational interiors for the way
            the client wants to live. Understanding and interpreting our
            clientsâ€™ aesthetic and lifestyle needs is an essential part of our
            skill set, in order that the design reflects their personality and
            responds to their individual lifestyle, tastes and aspirations. We
            pride ourselves on designing practical solutions for whatever the
            project requires. Each Project is designed with close attention to
            detail, managed and implemented with great care. We work with
            craftsmen and bespoke furniture makers as required, to create
            seamless, well executed and beautifully finished projects, delivered
            on time and on budget.

            Working primarily in and around London and the Home Counties, on
            schemes that range from small intimate spaces to large renovation
            and refurbishment projects. Our design skills encompass interior
            design, architecture and space planning through to creating bespoke
            furnishings, joinery and lighting design schemes. We can source
            unusual accessories, vintage and salvaged pieces as well as artwork
            for residential and commercial projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also visit the main trade shows including London, Milan and Paris
            in order to be able to offer our clients the best what is new,
            exquisite or vintage.
